## Challenges and Development

The development of MyStudyGuide has been an ongoing process, and I've encountered some challenges along the way. Here are a few of them:

1. **User Interface:** Initially, the app had a basic and bland user interface. I've been working on improving the UI to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly.

2. **Navigation:** Setting up navigation within the app was a bit tricky. I've made progress but continue to refine the navigation experience.

3. **Feature Expansion:** The app is currently in its bare-bones stage, and there's a lot more I plan to add, including user accounts and enhanced quiz features.

## What's Next

I am committed to making MyStudyGuide a robust and user-friendly study tool. Here's what's on my development roadmap:

- Enhancing the user interface to provide a more polished look.
- Expanding features such as user accounts and categories for flashcards.
- Improving navigation and overall user experience.
- Incorporating user feedback and suggestions.
